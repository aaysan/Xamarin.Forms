# Xamarin.Forms
Hello World!

I worked on a Xamarin.Forms project for the first three weeks of my internship. I developed user interfaces for both iOS and
Android using Xamarin.Forms. I have also worked on some C# code that has nothing to do with User Interfaces. 
These are the projects I have done during my learning process. I think I will be continuing on using Xamarin.Forms
after my internship too. Hopefully, I will be updating this soon.
